/**
 * Transactions are a fundamental component of SIP. A transaction is a request
 * sent by a client transaction to a server transaction, along with all
 * responses to that request sent from the server transaction back to the client
 * transactions. User agents contain a transaction layer, as do stateful proxies.
 * Stateless proxies do not contain a transaction layer. This specification
 * provides the capabilities to allow either the SipProvider or SipListener to
 * handle transactional functionality.
 * <p>
 * This interface represents a generic transaction interface defining the methods
 * common between client and server transactions.
